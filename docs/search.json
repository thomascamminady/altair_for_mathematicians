This method is efficient for performing mathematical operations but can be limiting when it comes to visualizing and understanding the data. On the other hand, data scientists prefer using dataframes, which are essentially two-dimensional tables with labeled axes, as they offer a more intuitive way to represent and manipulate data. Dataframes are particularly useful for visualization purposes, as they make it easier to generate interactive plots that provide a deeper understanding of the data."

The plot itself the consists of three components\n\nalt.Chart(df)\n\nstates that we want to create a chart using the data stored in df.\nNext is the mark that we want to use for visualization\n\nmark_line()\n\nimplies that we are using a line chart. We could have also used mark_point or mark_bar to create scatter or bar charts, respectively.\nLast is the encoding of the data.\n\nencode(\n    x=\"t\",\n    y=\"y\",\n)\n\nThis states what we are using as our plotting arguments.\n\nStyling our plot\nA lot of customization is possible when us altair.

First, .properties() allows us to specify properties of the plot such as width and height, but also the title. Adding the strokeWidth or color to the mark_line method specifies properties of the mark for the full plot. Using the syntax x=alt.X(...) is giving us more flexibility to specify properties than just writing x=\"t\". Note that we wrote t:Q instead of t. The Q specifies that we are using a quantitative variable instead of a nominal (N), ordinal (O), or temporal (T) variable. We don’t need to specify this here because altair is able to infer that we are plotting a quantitative variable. The scale parameter allows us to specify arguments related to the scale of the plot. The label of the y-axis is specified by the title argument inside alt.Y. The configure_axis and configure_title methods allow us to specify arguments relevant to the axis and title, respectively.\nAll of this is not pretty but gets the point across.\nYou can also choose a pre-defined theme.\n\nalt.themes.enable(\"fivethirtyeight\")\nalt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(\n    x=alt.X(\"t:Q\", scale=alt.Scale(domain=(-2, 22))),\n    y=alt.Y(\"y:Q\", title=\"Some title\"),\n)"

    "text": "Creating Example Data\nFor this example, let’s consider a dataset representing the population and GDP of several countries. The dataset consists of three columns: country name, population, and GDP. Our goal is to create a scatter plot that shows the relationship between population and GDP.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"country\": [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\", \"I\", \"J\"],\n        \"population\": [12, 65, 28, 130, 47, 76, 18, 88, 58, 110],\n        \"GDP\": [0.6, 2.8, 1.4, 5.5, 2.2, 3.8, 0.9, 4.5, 3.0, 4.7],\n    }\n)\n\nBasic Scatter Plot with Altair\nLet’s start by creating a basic scatter plot with Altair to visualize the relationship between population and GDP.\n\nimport altair as alt\n\nscatter_plot = (\n    alt.Chart(data)\n    .mark_circle()\n    .encode(x=\"population\", y=\"GDP\", tooltip=[\"country\", \"population\", \"GDP\"])\n    .properties(title=\"Scatter Plot: Population vs. GDP\")\n)\n\nscatter_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatter plot provides a basic overview of the relationship between population and GDP. However, we can enhance this visualization further by using logarithmic scales and different color schemes.\nScatter Plot with Logarithmic Scales\nIn many cases, data can span several orders of magnitude, making it difficult to discern patterns in a linear scale. By using logarithmic scales, we can more easily visualize relationships between variables that have a wide range of values.\n\nscatter_plot_log = (\n    alt.Chart(data)\n    .mark_circle()\n    .encode(\n        x=alt.X(\n            \"population\", scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\"), title=\"Population (Log Scale)\"\n        ),\n        y=alt.Y(\"GDP\", scale=alt.Scale(type=\"log\"), title=\"GDP (Log Scale)\"),\n        tooltip=[\"country\", \"population\", \"GDP\"],\n    )\n    .properties(title=\"Scatter Plot: Population vs. GDP (Logarithmic Scales)\")\n)\n\nscatter_plot_log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using logarithmic scales for both the x and y axes, we can more clearly see the relationship between population and GDP, even when the values span multiple orders of magnitude."
